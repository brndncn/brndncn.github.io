					This piece was a collaboration with Thomas Hagen for the Yale Open Music Initiative concert (spring 2019).
					</p>
					<p><b>Program Notes:</b>
					&#x201C;<i>Voice Dream</i> is an improvised ambient piece.
					Vocal tones were recorded up close, looped, and fed through filters and delay lines.
					These drones are overlaid with percussive samples similarly sent through delay lines with automated changes in delay time, distorting the sounds as they are replayed.&#x201D;
					</p>
					<p>
					You can watch the entire concert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0GrSG5IKU" target="_blank">here</a>.
					<i>Voice Dream</i> starts at approximately 9:05.

					This project was a collaboration with Journey Streams and Gema Martinez for the course <i>Scales of Design</i>.
					Our task was to design an &#x201C;enclosure for the human&#x201D;.
					</p>
					<p>
					&#x201C;Our enclosure is both physical and psychological.
					Two mirrors redirect the wearer’s line of vision so they only see their periphery.
					In this sense, the wearer is only aware of where they aren’t.
					</p><p>
					&#x201C;Each step forward becomes a step into the invisible.
					Auditory perception is also distorted, as the reverberation in the enclosure relocates incoming sound.
					The experience is isolatory, but also forces dependency on those nearby for the wearer to navigate safely through space.
					This sensory distortion is conveyed to the outside viewer through the warped mirror surface that refracts one’s surroundings, perplexing and unsettling even those who are not wearing it.&#x201D;

					Radione is an art project and experimental messaging service heavily inspired by the nature of conversations on walkie-talkie radios.
					Conversations on Radione are ephemeral, anonymous, and surveillable.
					Participants must either understand the flow of conversation well enough or develop a system to explicitly avoid collisions, otherwise, participants may talk over each other, resulting in incomprehensibility.

					This model was a project for the course <i>Scales of Design</i>.
					The task was to create a section of an assigned library and extend that section in two directions, creating a diptych where each half conveys different information about the building.
					</p>
					<p>
					The library depicted is the Biblioteca Vasconcelos in Mexico City.
					When standing in the center of the library, one sees bookshelves forming clouds along the ceiling, seemingly inaccessible from the ground floor.
					Staircases hidden behind the shelves are the only means of accessing the clouds, and the <a href="/assets/img/section/2.jpg" target="_blank">right half</a> of the diptych is a model of one portion of the library with removable shelves to reveal the hidden <a href="/assets/img/section/3.jpg" target="_blank">stairs</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					While the right half of the diptych uncovers the mystery of how the shelves are accessible, the left half of the diptych uncovers the mystery of how the clouds are suspended.
					The repeated concrete supports are dissected into their metal frame (as understood from construction photographs) and poured concrete construction, and are placed into context with a detailed elevation drawing at the back.
