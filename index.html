                            This project is a small three-axis phi-theta-z robot arm, designed from scratch as an exercise in building a mechatronic system.
                            The arm is moved by three stepper motors controlled by a Teensy microcontroller.

                            Ultimately, the mechanical design of the arm didn't allow as fine of control over position as I would have liked, and I hope to build a mk ii at some point in the future.

                            This project is a collection of tools and a proposed architecture for creating immersive musical experiences in Unity.
                            The tools facilitate the creation of metrically synchronized visuals by providing easy access to musical metric information from arbitrary scripts, shaders, post-processing "volumes", and animations.
                            This allows creators the ability to focus on content while abstracting away the details of metric synchronization.

                            The <i>Subtractice Synthesis Museum</i> was an AltspaceVR mini-museum teaching fundamentals of subtractive synthesis to listeners of electronic music.
                            The project explores how virtual reality can be used to leverage spatial elements, such as those of a museum, for pedagogical purposes, without incurring the costs of using a physical space.

                            AltspaceVR was chosen as the environment for this project, as it allowed the museum to be widely accessible (until Altspace's March 2023 shutdown).
                            AltspaceVR places limitations on the interactive capabilities of its spaces.
                            I'm excited to see how even more interactive spaces would serve as even better pedagogical tools.

                            Looping magnetic tapes of audio information is a well-established artistic practice.
                            Looping magnetic tapes of video is substantially less explored.
                            This project explores the technical and artistic possibilities of using VHS tape and VCRs themselves as a medium.

                            Vocal tones were recorded up close, looped, and fed through filters and delay lines.
                            These drones are overlaid with percussive samples similarly sent through delay lines with automated changes in delay time, distorting the sounds as they are replayed.&#x201D;

                            &#x201C;Our enclosure is both physical and psychological.
                            Two mirrors redirect the wearer’s line of vision so they only see their periphery.
                            In this sense, the wearer is only aware of where they aren’t.
                        </p><p>
                            &#x201C;Each step forward becomes a step into the invisible.
                            Auditory perception is also distorted, as the reverberation in the enclosure relocates incoming sound.
                            The experience is isolatory, but also forces dependency on those nearby for the wearer to navigate safely through space.
                            This sensory distortion is conveyed to the outside viewer through the warped mirror surface that refracts one’s surroundings, perplexing and unsettling even those who are not wearing it.&#x201D;

					                  Radione is an art project and experimental messaging service inspired by the nature of conversations on walkie-talkie radios.
					                  Conversations on Radione are ephemeral, anonymous, and surveillable.
					                  Participants must either understand the flow of conversation or develop a system to explicitly avoid collisions, otherwise, participants may talk over each other, resulting in incomprehensibility.

					                  <i>Angular Momentum Surgeon</i> is a JavaScript and Canvas game heavily inspired by (read: near clone of) the classic 1994 Macintosh game <i>Spin Doctor</i>.
					                  I completed it in 2017 for a high school project.
					                  The original files for the game were lost, but I found a partial backup of the game with the tutorials and one level.
