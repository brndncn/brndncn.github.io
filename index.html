					    <i>Helical Scan</i> was a sculptural installation at Yale University (November 2019, January 2020) exploring the technical possibilities of looping VHS tapes as well as the artistic possibilities of a living visual medium that decays over time.
					    You can watch video of <i>Helical Scan</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyPkuYn_Hpc&list=PLLPH6m6OeqGLP2vnrkYc_Rj93fe-F3jVT&index=2">here</a>.

					<p><b>Installation Notes:</b>
					Looping magnetic tapes of audio information is a well-established artistic practice.
					Looping magnetic tapes of video is substantially less explored.
					This project explores the technical and artistic possibilities of using VHS tape and VCRs themselves as a medium.
					</p>
					<p>
					This project was funded by a Yale College Creative and Performing Arts award.

					This piece was a collaboration with Thomas Hagen for the Yale Open Music Initiative concert (spring 2019).
					</p>
					<p><b>Program Notes:</b>
					&#x201C;<i>Voice Dream</i> is an improvised ambient piece.
					Vocal tones were recorded up close, looped, and fed through filters and delay lines.
					These drones are overlaid with percussive samples similarly sent through delay lines with automated changes in delay time, distorting the sounds as they are replayed.&#x201D;
					</p>
					<p>
					You can watch the entire concert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac0GrSG5IKU" target="_blank">here</a>.
					<i>Voice Dream</i> starts at approximately 9:05.

					This project was a collaboration with Journey Streams and Gema Martinez for the course <i>Scales of Design</i>.
					Our task was to design an &#x201C;enclosure for the human&#x201D;.
					</p>
					<p>
					&#x201C;Our enclosure is both physical and psychological.
					Two mirrors redirect the wearer’s line of vision so they only see their periphery.
					In this sense, the wearer is only aware of where they aren’t.
					</p><p>
					&#x201C;Each step forward becomes a step into the invisible.
					Auditory perception is also distorted, as the reverberation in the enclosure relocates incoming sound.
					The experience is isolatory, but also forces dependency on those nearby for the wearer to navigate safely through space.
					This sensory distortion is conveyed to the outside viewer through the warped mirror surface that refracts one’s surroundings, perplexing and unsettling even those who are not wearing it.&#x201D;

					Radione is an art project and experimental messaging service heavily inspired by the nature of conversations on walkie-talkie radios.
					Conversations on Radione are ephemeral, anonymous, and surveillable.
					Participants must either understand the flow of conversation well enough or develop a system to explicitly avoid collisions, otherwise, participants may talk over each other, resulting in incomprehensibility.
					</p>
					<p>
					You can view the source of Radione on <a href="https://github.com/brndncn/radi.one">GitHub</a>. 
					A Heroku instance of Radione runs at <a href="http://radi.one/">radi.one</a>.

					<i>Angular Momentum Surgeon</i> is a JavaScript and Canvas game heavily inspired by the classic 1994 Macintosh game <i>Spin Doctor</i>.
