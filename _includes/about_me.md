Hi!
My name's Brandon.
I'm an undergraduate at **Yale University** studying **Computing and the Arts**.
Below are some things I've worked on, in a very loose chronological order.

You can check out my GitHub [here](https://github.com/brndncn).

Feel free to reach out [here](mailto:brandon.canfield@yale.edu). Thanks for stopping by!
